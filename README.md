# NodeBlog
A blog webAPI written in Javascript, using Node.JS runtime and MongoDB.

This blog is complete with user registration via MongoDB. User authentication with a local passport.js strategy in conjunction with password encryption. Functional WYSIWYG editor. And a helper function to determine what database to use, be it in production or development.
Note, you will require MongoDB installed in order to use this blog. Or connect it to an external source such as MLabs. This blog has been made as a tutorial on node http routing and CRUD implementation, also featuring route protection.

This is based as an instructional blog, with focus on the code, not the front end design. As such simple bootstrap classes were applied.
